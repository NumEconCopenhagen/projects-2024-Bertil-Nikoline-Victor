    "### Conclusion\n",
    "In this project we have solved and visualized the basic and technological-growth-extended Malthus-model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we solved the basic model analytically using the Sympy-module where we lambdified the symbolic math functions into python functions to be solved with specified parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we solved the model numerically using the optimize.root command from Scipy using an efficient conjugate direction optimizer with fewer calculation steps in comparison to a 'steepest gradient' optimizer. In this part, we showed that we could find the same solution to the model both numerically and analytically. \n",
    "\n",
    "We visualized the basic model's convergence with implementations of shocks to production factors at arbitrary times, and/or with alterations of parameter values. The goal of this visualization was to help the reader understand the model's dynamics and the effect of individual parameters - something that may be lost in many economic models' sea of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the model was extended with technological growth following Carl-Johan Dalgaard's note \"A simple dynamic Malthusian Model\". The main point of this section was to visualize how the Malthusian model's output pr. worker always converges to a fixed value, even when both population and output goes towards infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project's main goal has been to clarify the Malthus-model's dynamics helping future students gain a better understanding of one of the many economic models that they will face in their time as university students."
