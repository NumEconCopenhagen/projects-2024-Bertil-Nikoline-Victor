# Model analysis project (Assignment 3)
This project is the second assignment completed by the group consisting of Victor V. Kristensen (gcp458), Nikoline K. L. Laursen (mxh836), Bertil D. H. Spring (fpg798) in the course **Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis** at the University of Copenhagen in Spring 2024.

## The purpose of the project
The project explores the dynamics of the Malthusian model by integrating technological growth and contrasting its numerical solution with the analytical one. It delves into the model’s behavior, assessing the impact of technological advancement on population trends and economic factors, and presents a comparative analysis over time.

## Files in the project
The project consists of a Jyputer-notebook file (modelproject.ipynb) and two python-files: ModelClass.py and GraphHelper.py.
* The **modelproject.ipynb** file provides an overview over the setup of the model, with extensions and comparisons between the numerical and analytical solutions.
* The **ModelClass.py** file defines a class for simulating the Malthusian growth model with added technological progress, including methods for symbolic and numerical analysis.
* The **GraphHelper.py** file contains a helper function to create graphs with a time variable.

## To run the project:
* The project has been tested using Python 3.11.7.


## **Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further installations
