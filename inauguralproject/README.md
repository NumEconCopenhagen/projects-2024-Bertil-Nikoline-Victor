# Inaugural Project (Assignment 1)
This project is the first assignment completed by the group consisting of Victor V. Kristensen (gcp458), Nikoline K. L. Laursen (mxh836), Bertil D. H. Spring (fpg798) in the course **Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis** at the University of Copenhagen in Spring 2024.

## The purpose of the project
The project is a simulation of different scenarios where two agents in an exchange economy trade based on different endowments. The project can help the reader understand which allocations will be pareto improvements or socially optimal.

## Files in the project
The project consists of a Jyputer-notebook file (InauguralProject2024.ipynb) and two python-files: ExchangeEconomy.py and GraphHelper.py.
* The **InauguralProject2024.ipynb** file provides an overview with answers to each of the questions in the assignment.
* The **ExchangeEconomy.py** file contains the ExchangeEconomyClass which can be used to calculate demand, utility and check market clearing for two consumers in a exchange economy.
* The **GraphHelper.py** file contains a helper function to create an Edgeworth box.

## To run the project
* The project has been tested using Python 3.11.7.
