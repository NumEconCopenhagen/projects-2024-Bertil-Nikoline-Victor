This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project.
3. Model project.

Each project folder contains a README.md file that describes the individual project and the files within the folder, including the possible dependencies to run the specific project.

## Use of AI
AI has been used to look up how specific python functions can be used - e.g. how functions can be used in different examples. However all the code in the project has been written by ourselves, so AI has only been used to better understand how different functions can be used. AI has also been scarcely used for proofreading selected text passages throughout the project.
